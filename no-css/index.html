          <p>It may seem odd for a CSS framework to be categorically against writing CSS.</p>

          <p>The last 5% is important. But that's the style stuff that really sets your site apart&mdash; it deserves all of your visual design attention, not the in-the-weeds CSS stuff.</p>

            <h2>The counter-curriculum</h2>
  
            <p>Nobody ever really <em>learns</em> CSS, just as nobody ever really steps through the same river twice. CSS is an ever-changing notion of what style on the internet should be.</p>
  
            <p>HTML meanwhile is pretty much the same as it's always been.</p>
            
            <p>So do that instead.</p>
            
            <p>Even people who are very good at CSS should try to write as little of it as possible. Even the&mdash;<em>gasp</em>&mdash; people who <em>like writing CSS</em> should write as little of it as possible.</p>
            
            <p>No, <em>especially</em> those people.</p>
  
            <p>CSS isn't dead. On the contrary, it's better than it's ever been. But it's gone from being something everyone on the team needs to know, to something only one person on the team needs to know. Unless you're that person, <em>don't bother learning CSS</em>.</p>

            <p>Learning in general has a cost. We'd say it's time but really it boils down to space in our brain.</p>
            
            <p>Cavepaint keeps everything easy with simple class names with no numbers, and words taken mostly from CSS. You don't really learn it. You just use it.</p>
  
            <p>It's designed for cavemen (and women), after all. It has class names like "blue" and "big." The classes sound a bit like caveman-speak when put together.</p>
  
            <p>Cavepaint gets out of your way and lets you get to building. It doesn't lock you in because it's almost 99% pure CSS. There's no workflow to learn because there's no workflow.</p>
  
            <p>At the end of the day, there are more interesting things to learn. Spend your time developing skills in deep learning or doing Clojure koans, not in CSS.</p>

            <p>Your site doesn't use the h4 tag, so you found a tool that removes the h4 rule from your CSS. Cool, right?</p>
  
            <p>Wrong. This is an anti-pattern. This is CSS anarchy!</p>

                <p>Well, it's better <em>at first</em>. This is only half anti-pattern! If it stays small, that's great. If it bloats, then it can be bad. And it's going to bloat, because you'll need to write more CSS to navigate around all that minimalism.</p>

                <h3>The wrong metrics</h3>
                <p>The Cavepaint approach is that it's better to start at 30kb and balloon to 40 or maybe 45kb than it is to start at 3kb and balloon into a 100kb mess.</p>
  
                <p>Cavepaint is going for <strong>bang-per-kb</strong>. It's a middleweight library that punches way above its class. Start at 30kb and use that CSS over and over.</p>
  
                <p>Optimize on readability, performance and utility, not file size.</p>

            <h2>Eyedropping out</h2>
  
            <p>Picking colors is fun. That's the first red flag.</p>
  
            <p>We're not saying it's always a waste of time. We're just saying there are <em>severely diminishing returns</em> after picking out the first color associated with your site. So in Cavepaint you pick only the one, the <span class="base-color text-padding rounded">base&nbsp;color</span>.</p>
  
            <p>Figuring out colors for use in your site is a breeze with 500+ colors that <em>just work</em> with your base color. Contrast is always white or black text and Cavepaint figures that part out for you.</p>
  
            <p>Because the expressive composable classes let you use colors like <span class="warm dark blue text-padding rounded">warm&nbsp;dark&nbsp;blue</span>, <span class="bright red text-padding rounded">bright&nbsp;red</span> or <span class="dim green text-padding rounded">dim&nbsp;green</span>, you can save time on tangling with color droppers and color contrast tools. Describe the colors on your site <em>with words</em>.</p>
  
            <p>Even if you do pick colors yourself, it's better to use and override the Cavepaint classes. That way, your markup never needs to change. This also means you don't need to go through and update every color on your site when you update your base color, or when you override colors in the color scheme.</p>
  
            <p>Every color in Cavepaint is based on the <span class="base-color text-padding rounded">base&nbsp;color</span>. If you multiply the 16.7 million colors in the color space with Cavepaint's extended 3500-color palette, then Cavepaint supports <em>billions</em> of colors.</p>

            <p>But we get it. Javascript is a big deal. It's probably running a big portion of whatever you're working on. We can't help you with your Javascript problem.</p>
  
            <p>What we can do is <em>only</em> CSS. We can get out of your way so that Cavepaint works with whichever framework you're using, so long as it supports HTML/CSS.</p>

            <p>Don't minify Cavepaint. Leave it human-readable. Don't take out the colors you didn't use&mdash; leave the whole palette there for someone else to use. Your user, maybe?</p>
  
            <p>Don't sprongify it or run reverse amplitude deflections on it. (Both of these are made up...we think.) Generate it here and customize it in the file as your project needs. Write your own CSS on top of (after) it. Don't ever come back here. Enjoy CSS bliss.</p>
  
            <p>Or, do all of the nitty-gritty technical stuff. Cavepaint is basic CSS so we can't stop you. The point is that with Cavepaint, you have the option. It doesn't enforce any workflow upon you. (Although it has a great workflow based in Less, if you do go that route.)</p>
