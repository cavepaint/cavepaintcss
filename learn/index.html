<h2>The CSS version</h2>

<p>The CSS version of Cavepaint makes for a great starting point for any project, big or small. It is the <strong>no-CSS no-framework CSS framework</strong>.</p>

<div class="inner-card-width margin-auto text-center margin-bottom">
    <h6>CSS version</h6>
    <p>
        <a class="big warm blue button" id="download_it" href="../../cavepaint.css" download="cavepaint.css">Get the CSS</a>
    </p>
</div>

<p>It is, simply put, the best framework for writing CSS.</p>

<p class="gutter-bottom">But more importantly, it's the best framework for <em>not</em> writing CSS, instead relying on styles composed through the HTML.</p>

<div class="two-column golden tablet margin gutter-bottom small">
    <div class="inner-card-width">
        <p class=""><strong>Tiny sites</strong> will benefit from the full feature set. Easily add updates/features/content when you come back and make an update months later.</p>
        <p>Razor-thin CSS files will leave you writing more CSS later. Cavepaint lets you express your design in the HTML.</p>

<h2>The Less version</h2>

<ol class="text-align-left">
    <li>Get <a target="_blank" class="new-tab" href="https://github.com/cavepaint/cavepaintCSS">the files</a>. Or:</li>
    <li><code>git clone https://github.com/cavepaint/cavepaintCSS.git</code></li>
    <li>Use the files <em>as your codebase</em>.</li>
    <li>Install Less: <code>npm install less -g</code></li>
    <li>Run Less:<code>lessc cavepaint.less cavepaint.css</code></li>
</ol>

<p>It's that easy! If anything here confuses you, or if you just want more, check out the <a class="new-tab" href="http://lesscss.org/usage/" target="_blank">Less usage guide</a>. There are a whole lot of ways to compile Less.</p>

<h2>Where to write your styles</h2>

<p>If you're using the CSS version, write or include your styles <em>after</em> cavepaint.css</p>

<p>For the Less version, use the Cavepaint download as a starting point for your style codebase.</p>

<h2>Moving from CSS to Less</h2>

<p>Cavepaint uses the same conventions everywhere. You can get started using the CSS version and your markup will work when or if you transition to Less.</p>

<p>Plenty of projects don't even get off the ground. Don't set up your Less codebase until you need to.</p>

<p>When you do move to Less, here are some quick tips to get started:</p>

<ul class="card-width margin-auto">
    <li>Edit <strong>properties.less</strong> for your basic settings.</li>
    <li>Edit elements, colors, and mixins in their own files.</li>
    <li>Add whatever you want. Use the Less project as a starting point.</li>
    <li>Don't bother with updating or adding Cavepaint as a dependency.</li>
</ul>

<section id="composables">
    <h2>Cavepaint overview</h2>
    <p>More and more the internet is made of components. They're usually defined with three parts: Style, markup and code. <strong>Composables</strong> fill the style role, designed to work with any markup and code.</p>
    <p>Like how React is "just the V" in MVC, Cavepaint is just the styling for components.</p>
    <p>Composable CSS classes are written to be simple and work with the other composable classes. They typically output more than one property. They might have rules supporting other composable classes.</p>
    <p>Cavepaint works like sort of a caveman jargon for your CSS project, where the vocabulary is mostly based on pre-existing CSS terms. The words are simple, powerful and meant to be combined with others.</p>
    <div class="card-width margin-auto default padding margin small">
      <h3 class="no-margin-top">Naming conventions</h3>
      <p>Cavepaint keeps things simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No numerals (1, 5, 100, etc)</li>
        <li>No abbreviations (xt, MGS, xt:phablet-xxt)</li>
        <li>If it already exists, use that word</li>
        <li>"No" is powerful, and overrides other classes</li>
        <li>One- or two-word shortcuts to everything useful</li>
        <li>CSS property names apply project-level property defaults</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The Cavepaint site and docs are styled using Cavepaint, with no custom CSS on top.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h5>"I don't know CSS. Can I use Cavepaint?"</h5>
      <p>All you need to use Cavepaint is knowledge of how HTML works. If you can put together HTML elements and add classes to those elements, you're ready to use Cavepaint.</p>
      <p>In fact, Cavepaint is a great way to learn CSS, because so many of the classes and conventions use names and terms from CSS.</p>

      <h5>"I don't know Less. Can I use Cavepaint?"</h5>
      <p>Cavepaint is powered by Less, the CSS preprocessor. It's made in a way where anyone on the team can use it, though. You don't need to know Less.</p>
      <p>When your project is ready for a professional-level CSS approach with Less, switch over to the Less version. Until then, just use the CSS for any project, big or small.</p>

      <h5>"How do I port all of my colors over from Photoshop?"</h5>
      <p>Keep your colors in your Less codebase. Use Cavepaint's colors as a starting point and override them with your own when you've got time for refinements.</p>
      <p>Cavepaint is officially against complicated workflows. That includes maintaining a working copy of how your website looks in a desktop program, and in your web codebase.</p>
