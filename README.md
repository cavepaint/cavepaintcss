# Cavepaint CSS

A CSS framework for putting together beautiful websites fast without wasting time on setup or complicated workflows.

## Features

* Quickly put together the basic look and feel of any page using only HTML
* Amazing bang-per-KB with composable classes
* No workflow setup
* Over 500 colors using the composable color system
* Text and contrast rules based on smart typographical defaults
* Do 95% of your layout work without touching CSS
* Save your team's time with conventions that anyone can learn and remember

## CSS version

Just grab a file from https://cavepaint.github.io/cavepaintcss/

Use the CSS version first even for more complicated projects. Hit the ground running! Don't get mired in CSS.

## Less version

* <code>git clone https://github.com/cavepaint/cavepaintCSS.git</code>
* Install Less: <code>npm install less -g</code>
* Run Less: <code>lessc cavepaint.less cavepaint.css</code>
* Write any CSS or Less separately and load it in after

The Less version really is that easy. There's no canonical package to grab and then store as a pristine copy somewhere. Cavepaint is the starting point of your Less codebase. You can christen it as your project by renaming **cavepaint.less** to whatever you want. Enjoy:

* No "chiseling" or CSS culling needed, although Cavepaint will work with standard CSS optimization approaches
* Specialized Less mixins for dealing with color and contrast
* Parametric mixins for targeting breakpoints
* Simple codebase structure with clear names and quick compilation times
